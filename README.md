Optimal-Stopping-Theory-Test
============================

This is a Python script to test Optimal Stopping Theory by generating 1,000 random numbers between 1 and 100, and picking one according to the theory's guidelines.  The goal is to pick the highest number possible.  According to the theory, this should happen about 33% of the time if you let a third of the options go by, then pick the next number that is higher than all of the others that have been passed over until then.
