Optimal-Stopping-Theory-Test
============================

This is a Python script to test Optimal Stopping Theory by generating 1,000 random numbers between 1 and 100, and picking one according to the theory's guidelines.  The goal is to pick the highest number possible.  According to the theory, this should happen about 36.8% of the time if you let a third of the options go by, then pick the next number that is higher than all of the others that have been passed over until then. 

The ipython notebook performs 1000 simulations.
